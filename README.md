# Game Dev FMI Course 2020/2021
## Sharing the game I made thoughout the game dev course at FMI. This is just the game I developed from the homeworks we were given the project I worked on you can find [here](https://gitlab.com/Nakahotty/3d-topdown-shooter).

<br>

## Laser Shooting Platform Hopping Alien - that is the game. Build with Unity and without using external packages (every feature was developed by me).

<br>

## You can actually download and test the first 2 levels I created. The first level is mostly with handput platforms, but in the second you will notice it is always randomly generated! [Download Link](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/7ijuxl1ehshhb/AlienPlatformerUnityBuild)
